                        &emsp;I develop a theory of digital marketplaces where an intermediary provides a
                        platform for firms to list their product and where consumers engage in costly
                        search to learn about the products. I find that when prices can be observed
                        prior to costly search, a firm higher in the list charges a higher price and earns
                        a larger profit. This result is in contrast with those from the standard models
                        of prominence where prices are discovered after search. I augment this model
                        by allowing the intermediary to determine, endogenously, the order in which
                        products are displayed by conducting an auction. The effect of the auction on
                        product prices is captured by the auction reserve price, which is chosen by
                        the intermediary to maximise its commission from firms. I show that these
                        commissions (paid per-click) enter the pricing equations as a fixed cost for the
                        prominent firm while being analogous to marginal cost for the non-prominent
                        firm. This asymmetry in equilibrium lowers consumer surplus, firmsâ€™ profits,
                        conversion (ratio of buyers to visitors) rate of non-prominent firm and total
                        transactions in the market.
